                    <li>The Great Wall is the largest man-made project in the world. The complete route is over 20,000 km, stretching from the east seaside to the west desert in northern China, winding up and down across mountains and plateaus like a dragon.</li>
                    <li>The Great Wall is the largest man-made project in the world. The complete route is over 20,000 km, stretching from the east seaside to the west desert in northern China, winding up and down across mountains and plateaus like a dragon.</li>
                    <li>It took over 2,000 years to construct the wall</li>
                    <li>The Great Wall is not a single-structured wall, it includes beacon towers, barriers, barracks, garrison stations, and fortresses along the walls, together forming an integrated defense system.</li>
                    <li>The Great Wall is a massive monument built with different materials. Most of the sections we see today were built with bricks and cut stone blocks, and lime mortar was used to hold the bricks together.</li>
                    <li>Shanhai Pass was a fortress built in the Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644) and is the first pass in the East of China. It is located outside of Qinhuangdao City on Bohai Bay and 305 km away from Beijing.</li>
                    <li>Jiayu Pass is famous for being the first frontier fortress at the western end of the Great Wall of China in the Ming Dynasty.</li>
                    <li>The Great Wall is the product of countless labors over a period of 2,000 years, and is a feast of engineering. It also reflected the collision and exchanges between the agricultural and nomadic civilizations. </li>

                <h3>THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.</li>
                    <li>Egyptologists conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it was built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years.</li>
                    <li>Initially standing at 146.5 metres, the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Throughout history the majority of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to the present 138.5 metres. What is seen today is the underlying core structure.</li>
                    <li>The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres, which includes an internal hillock.</li>
                    <li>The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks weighing 6 million tonnes total.</li>

                <h3>THE COLOSSEUM</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Colosseum or Coliseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built.</li>
                    <li>The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian.</li>
                    <li>These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name.</li>
                    <li>The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.</li>
                    <li>The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face.</li>
                    <li>Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres high, excluding its 8-metre pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres wide.</li>
                    <li>The statue weighs 635 metric tons, and is located at the peak of the 700-metre Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. </li>
                    <li> A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</li>
                    <li>It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.</li>

                <h3>PETRA, JORDAN</h3>
                <img src="https://theplanetd.com/images/petra-jordan-photos-the-treasury.jpg" alt="Petra" width="400px">
                <ul>
                    <li>Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.</li>
                    <li>The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital.</li>
                    <li>Small hand-size holes climb up both sides of the building, like scaffolding. Experts believe a master builder led a team of stonemasons that started from a rock-cut platform at the top of the mountain, then chiseled their way down.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.</li>
                    <li>Most archeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti. Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest.</li>
                    <li>According to the new AMS radiocarbon-dating, it was occupied from c. 1420-1532.
                    Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.</li>
