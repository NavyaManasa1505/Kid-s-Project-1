                A Symbol is a sign to help us recognize something. Every country has some symbols which tells us about the identity values and culture of that country. Our National flag, National Emblem, National anthem, National animal, National bird and National flower are the symbols of our freedom and unity. Let's find out what they are:
            </p>
            <div class="content-1">
                <h3>THE NATIONAL FLAG</h3>
                <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/indian-flag-picture-id177387875?k=20&m=177387875&s=612x612&w=0&h=IHAO1FNk5eKA-OnZfRhSFRScopr7vDuKWUzfiA6ej34=" alt="National Flag" width="400px">
                <p>Our National flag is called a tiranga or the tri-colour, because it has three colours:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Saffron</b> stands for courage and sacrifice</li>
                        <li><b>White</b> stands for truth, peace and unity</li>
                        <li><b>Green</b> stands for prosperity</li>
                    </ul>
                    In the centre, there is a wheel in navy blue colour with 24 spokes known as the Ashoka Chakra.
                    The flag is always made of Khadi cloth or silk. The national flag should always be respected. It should never touch the ground.
