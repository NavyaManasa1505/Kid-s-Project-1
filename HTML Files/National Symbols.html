                <h3>THE NATIONAL FLAG</h3>

                <p>Our National flag is called a tiranga or the tri-colour, because it has three colours:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Saffron</b> stands for courage and sacrifice</li>
                        <li><b>White</b> stands for truth, peace and unity</li>
                        <li><b>Green</b> stands for prosperity</li>
                    </ul>
                    In the centre, there is a wheel in navy blue colour with 24 spokes known as the Ashoka Chakra.
                    The flag is always made of Khadi cloth or silk. The national flag should always be respected. It should never touch the ground.
