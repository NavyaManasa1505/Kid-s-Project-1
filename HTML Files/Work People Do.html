            <p>We have learnt that we all need food to eat, clothes to wear and a shelter to live in. We can get all these only if we have the money to buy them. To earn money, we have to do some work. Any work done to earn money is called an occupation. Everyone does not do the same type of work. People in our country follow different occupations. People work as teachers, scientists, doctors, engineers, nurses, carpenters, barbers tailors, shopkeepers and so on. Let us read about some common occupations.</p>

                <h3>FARMING</h3>
                <p>In India, a large number of people live in villages. Farming or Agriculture is the main occupation of the people in the villages. They grow different crops such as wheat, sugarcane, rice, oilseeds, pulses, jowar etc. The climate, the type of soil and the amount of water available determine the crops that can grow best in a region. The crops grown also depend on the season.</p>

                <h3>REARING ANIMALS</h3>
                <p>Different animals are reared for different purposes. Cattle farming consists of rearing cattle like goats, cows, buffaloes and bullocks. We get milk from cows, buffaloes and goats. We also get meat from goats. Bullock is used for ploughing and drawing carts. Rearing animals for milk or <b>dairy farming</b> is an important occupation because milk and milk products are consumed in great quantities in our country.<b>Poultry farming</b> involves rearing hens, ducks and geese for their meat and eggs. In coastal areas, fishing is an important occupation. Fish is a staple food for many people. We also get oil and other products from fish. Fishes are sometimes also reared in big tanks. This is known as <b>fish farming</b>.</p>

We also get paper from trees. Trees have to be cut to make paper. So, we should not waste paper.</p>
