            <p>We need to travel from one place to another all the time for various purposes Such as marriages, functions etc. We can walk to places which are very close. But to go to far places, we have to use a bicycle, rickshaw, scooter, car, bus, train, ship or aeroplane. These are all different means of transport. The vehicle we use depends on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>location of the place</li>
                <li>distance to be covered</li>
                <li>time available</li>
                <li>money we can spend</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are three types of transport-land, air and water.</p>
