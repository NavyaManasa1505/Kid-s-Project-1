                        <li><b>Contribution: </b>Ambedkar played a key role in the formation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1935. Back in 1955, he was the first person to propose the partition of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar for better government. He also wanted to make Sanskrit the Indian union's official language and he took part in the 'Lok Sabha' election twice but failed to win on both occasions. 'Waiting for a Visa,' his autobiography, is used as a textbook at Columbia University. He was opposed to the principle of employment and constituency reservation and didn't want the system to exist at all. He was the first Indian to earn a Ph.D. degree outside of India. Ambedkar was the one who pushed for a reduction in India's working hours from 14 to eight hours a day. He was a vocal opponent of the Indian constitution's 'Article 370,' which granted the state of Jammu and Kashmir special status. The main goal of the organization was to provide education to the backward classes. In 1927, he continuously worked against untouchability. He followed the footsteps of Gandhi and led a Satyagraha movement. The untouchables were denied access to the main source of drinking water and entry in Temples. He fought for the rights of the untouchables. In 1932, the "Poona Pact" was formed that allowed reservation for the depressed class in the regional legislative assembly and central council states. In 1935, he founded the "Independent labor party," which secured fourteen seats in the Bombay election.A child who was subject to caste discrimination went on to become a man who was the architect of Independent India's constitution.</li>

The agitation of zamindars of Bardoli against the increased taxes was led successfully by Sardar Patel in the year 1928. After this movement, he was recognized as “Sardar” which means “leader”. Sardar Patel was sentenced to imprisonment for three months at the time of 1930 Salt Satyagraha. The Karachi session of the Indian National Congress was presided over by Sardar Patel in 1931. He took part in Mahatma Gandhi's movement of disobedience and was arrested by the British Police in 1940. He was imprisoned at that time for a period of nine months. He lost almost 20 pounds of weight while serving his term in jail. Sardar Patel was arrested for the third time at the time of Quit India Movement (1942) and his period of imprisonment was 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar. The Congress Party was led by him in 1937 elections and he was one of the prominent contenders for the post of Congress President in 1937. However, he withdrew his nomination and was replaced by Jawaharlal Nehru upon receiving Gandhi's advice. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is one of the most vital names in India's struggle for Independence. On 31st October 2018, his birth anniversary, the present Indian government unveiled the world's tallest statue named 'Statue of Unity' in his memory. The statue with a height of 182 meters (597 ft) stands on the bank of the Sardar Sarovar Dam near Vadodara in Gujarat.</li>

He was considered as a central warrior in Indian Politics before independence as well as after independence. He was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad and served the nation from 1947 until his death in 1964. The birthplace of Jawahar Lal Nehru is Prayagraj which is in Ahmedabad. Due to his association with the Kashmiri Pandit community, he was also known as Pandit Nehru, while the Indian kids referred to them as Chacha Nehru. Jawahar Lal Nehru's birthday is widely celebrated as children's day. His father's name is Motilal Nehru who served as Indian Prime minister in 1919 and 1928. His mother's name is Swarup Rani Thussu and she was the second wife of Motilal's. Jawahar Lal Nehru had 2 sisters and he was the eldest among all.

                        <li><b>Contribution: </b>Nehru's first significant national participation came at the beginning of the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920. Nehru was arrested in 1921 on charges of anti-government activities Nehru remained loyal to Gandhi in the rift that developed within the Congress following the sudden closure of the Non-Cooperation movement after the Chauri Chaura incident and did not join the Swaraj Party formed by his father Motilal Nehru and CR Das. The Salt Satyagraha succeeded in attracting the world's attention. Increasingly, Indian, British, and world views started to accept the validity of the Congress party's independence claims. Nehru found the high-water mark of his involvement with Gandhi to be the salt satyagraha and thought that its enduring significance was in transforming Indian attitudes. Nehru served for 18 years as prime minister, first as temporary prime minister, and then as prime minister of the Republic of India from 1950. In the 1946 elections Congress captured a majority of seats in the assembly and, with Nehru as the prime minister, led the provisional government. On 15 August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of Free India. On 15 August, he took office because the Prime Minister of India and gave his inaugural entitled "Tryst with Destiny".</li>

                        <li><b>About: </b>Mathematics is the pillar of Science and Technology. The advancement of human civilization can be somewhat attributed to this subject. Many modern discourses such as Numerology also have their origin in Mathematics. The credit for all these belongs to one and only Mr Srinivasa Ramanujan. To pay tribute to him, 22nd December, his birthday is celebrated as the National Mathematics Day. The Theory of Numbers developed by him became an asset, based on which, infinite series, permutation and combination and even probability were developed. The Law of Averages and even the logic of mathematical analysis were invented by this great mathematician.

                        <li><b>Contribution: </b>Over the course of his life, he went on to develop thousands of his own formulas, many of which have continued to be used in mathematics and science. In fact his formulas are even used to understand the workings of black holes.He originally created some of his theories while in India, though when he travelled to Cambridge in England to discuss his mathematical formulas with the brightest minds of the time, he created many there too. It was in England that Ramanujan began an inspirational partnership with the Cambridge professor Godfrey Harold Hardy. Professor Hardy realised that Ramanujan had discovered certain mathematical formulas by himself that were actually already known to the mathematical elite. However, what was more striking was that he created his own formulas, which warranted further understanding. Most of his theories have been proven correct over time and have provided mathematicians since then with the basis from which to create formulas that continue to shape science today.</li>

Despite being a non-Indian she had spent almost her whole life helping the people of India. Mother Teresa received her name from the church after the name of St. Teresa. She was a Christian by birth and a spiritual lady. She was a nun by choice. She was undoubtedly a saintly lady with oodles of kindness and compassion in her. She was a deeply pious lady and a Catholic Christian. Her real name was Agnes Gonxhe Bojaxhiu. She was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital city of the Republic of Macedonia. She spent a major part of her early life in the church. But in the beginning, she did not think about becoming a nun. Mother Teresa came to Kolkata (Calcutta), India after finishing her work in Dublin. She got the new name of Teresa. Her motherly instincts fetched her beloved name Mother Teresa, by which the whole world knows her. When in Kolkata, she used to be a teacher at a school. It is here from where her life went through vigorous changes and eventually she was bestowed with the title “Saint of Our Times”.

She began her era of humanity by opening an open-air school where she gave education to poor children. Her journey started without any aid from anyone. Some days later she started to teach the poor kids and help them regularly. For this purpose, she required a permanent place. The place would be regarded as her headquarters and a place of shelter for the poor and homeless people. Mother Teresa had built up Missionaries of Charity where poor and homeless people could spend their entire lives with the help of the church and people. Later on, numerous schools, homes, dispensaries and hospitals were established by her both in and outside of India with the help of the people and the then government.</li>

                        <li><b>Contribution: </b>Bhave observed the life of the average Indian living in a village and tried to find solutions for the problems he faced with a firm spiritual foundation. This formed the core of his Sarvodaya movement.The Brahma Vidya Mandir is one of the ashrams that Bhave created. It is a small community for women that was created in order for them to become self-sufficient and non-violent in a community. This group farms to get their own food, but uses Gandhi's beliefs about food production, which include sustainability and social justice, as a guide. This community, like Gandhi and Bhave, has been influenced greatly by the Bhagavad-Gita and that is also used to determine their practices.He took donated land from land owner Indians and gave it away to the poor and landless, for them to cultivate. Then after 1954, he started to ask for donations of whole villages in a programme he called Gramdan. He got more than 1000 villages by way of donation. Out of these, he obtained 175 donated villages in Tamil Nadu alone.</li>
