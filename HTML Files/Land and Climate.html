            <p>Our Country, India is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. It has many landforms. Some places have mountains while other have flat land. At some places, the land is made up of rocks. Let us learn about the different landforms.</p>

                <h3>HILLS AND MOUNTAINS</h3>

                <p>A high land with a round top is called <b>hills</b>. The <i>Vindhya Ranges</i> in the central India and the <i>Nilgiri Hills</i> in south india are the examples of hills.</p>
                <p>Very high hills with sharp tops are called <b>mountains</b>. Montain ranges are so high and so cold that some of the peaks are forever covered with snow. Infact, the word Himalaya ifself means <b>'the home of snow'</b>. The himalayan mountain ranges stretch from the north-west to the north-east. There are many peaks in these mountains. They stop the cold winds that blow from the north. Without them even the plains of the north would be freezing and filled with snow!</p>
                <p><b>Mount Everest</b> is the highest peak in the Himalayan mountain ranges. It is situated on the Nepal-China border. Many rivers such as Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra and Satluj originate in the mountains and slow down to the plains. These rivers are formed by melting snow of the Himalayas.</p>

                <p>The Great Plains of India lies towards the south of the Himalayas. These are the flat lands formed by the fertile soil left behind by the Himalayan rivers. This fine soil is called <b>silt</b> and is good for growing different crops. In the plains, summers are hot and the winters are cold.</p>
                <p>A lot of people live in the Northen Plains. There is a narrow strip of flat land along the eastern and western coasts of India. It is known as the Eastern Coastal Plain and the Western Coastal Plains Respectively. These plains meet at Kanyakumari. Rivers such as the Narmada, Tapi, Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri flow through these plains and fall into the sea. The coastal areas are neither very hot nor very cold.</p>

                <p>A peninsula is a landform that reaches out into the sea. It is surrounded by the water on the three sides, but is to main land on one side. A large part of southern India is a peninsula and a plateau. Infact, It is known as the Great Indian Peninsula or the Deccan or southern plateau. The Deccan plateau has many rivers. They depend on the rain for water. Some part of plateau are covered with thick forests. However, these areas are not as fertile as the plains. The Satpura and Vindhya ranges of hills in central India seperate the Deccan plateau from the plains of the North.</p>

                <p>A desert is the large area of land covered with sand. In the north-western part of India lies the Indian Desert or the Thar Desert. It covers a large part of Rajasthan. The desert area is very hot and dry. It does not rain very often in the desert. Water is less and people staying there often need to walk a long way to fetch water from deep wells. Since the soil is dry and water is hard to get, it is difficult to grow plants & trees in the desert.</p>
