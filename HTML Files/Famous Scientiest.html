                <h4>01. ALBERT EINSTEIN</h4>
                <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/3eqzgvaLr4CgZMMUuFeaaQ/68b9c9168798a545a7a4019982c01689/Albert_Einstein_-_Mark_Marturello_-_3_DSC-A0517_02.jpg?fm=jpg&fl=progressive&w=660&h=433&fit=pad" alt="Albert Einstein" width="600px">
                <p>Albert Einstein was a Theoretical Physicist of German origin. He is the one who developed a pillar of modern Physics, the Theory of Relativity. Be it his mass-energy equivalence formula or his law of photoelectric effect, the theories he postulated changed the history of science forever. His works are still studied in standard institutions of learning throughout the world. Albert Einstein was born on 14th March 1879 in Ulm in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in the German empire. His father's name was Herman Einstein and his mother's name was Pauline Koch. His father worked as a salesman and as an engineer. In 1880, his father along with his family moved to Munich. His father and his uncle founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie. It is a company that manufactures electrical equipment based on direct current. After birth, Albert Einstein's head was much larger than his body and he was born as a deformed abnormal child. Usually, children start speaking at the age of 2, but Albert Einstein started speaking after 4 years of age. When Einstein was 5 years old, his father gifted him with a magnetic compass on his birthday. The needle of the compass used to be in the North Direction, and seeing this, he became very fascinated and developed an interest to explore science well. Albert received a patent officer job at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property in Bern, Switzerland, at the age of 23, after completing college. While working there, he completed his Ph.D., after which he became a professor at the University of Zurich. During this period he gave the theory of mass-energy (E = mc2). The atomic bombs dropped in Japan were built on this principle. However, throughout his life, Albert Einstein was against the atomic bomb dropped on Japan. He then gave a new theory of relativity, falsifying the old rules of relativity given by Isaac Newton, which proved that time and light are not constant. If traveling at the speed of light, i.e. 300000 km, it will be slow, and millions of years have passed on Earth. That is, he proved that time travel can be done. However, till date scientists have not been able to build a spaceship that can travel at the speed of light. In 1977, NASA conducted an experiment to prove this theory in which they set the clock in a satellite and were left to orbit the Earth. After a few years, when the satellite's clock was checked, it was much slower than the Earth's clock. In this theory of quantum physics, Indian scientist Satyendra Nath Bose wrote a letter from India to Albert Einstein in which he said that Newton's relativity theory is wrong. Albert Einstein then agreed to the letter of Satyendra Nath Bose, and he published that paper and later gave a new theory of relativity. Albert Einstein made many other inventions with this theory. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1981 for his photoelectric effect.  Later research was done on Albert Einstein's brain and it was found that the parts of Einstein's brain that were for mathematical calculus had developed 15% more as compared to the brains of normal people. The whole world celebrates Albert Einstein's birthday on 14th March as World Genius Day. He had published more than 300 research papers on science in his life and had contributed to the advancement of science. This is the reason that Times magazine has awarded Albert Einstein the title of Person of the Century. Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</p>

                <p>Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1643 to 20 March 1726/27) was an English physicist, mathematician and astronomer. He is well known for his work on the laws of motion, optics, gravity, and calculus. In 1687, Newton published a book called the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in which he presents his theory of universal gravitation and three laws of motion.Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope in 1668. He also developed a theory of light based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colors of the rainbow. Newton also shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of calculus. Newton's ideas on light, motion, and gravity dominated physics for the next three centuries, until modified by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1666 Isaac Newton experimented with light, and found that different colours had different refractions. He began lecturing on this topic in 1670. Newton explained the workings of the universe through mathematics. He described laws of motion and gravitation. These laws are math formulas that explain how objects move when a force acts on them. Newton published his most famous book, Principia, in 1687 while he was a mathematics professor at Trinity College, Cambridge. In the Principia, Newton explained three basic laws that govern the way objects move. He then described his idea, or theory, about gravity. Gravity is the force that causes things to fall down. If a pencil fell off a desk, it will land on the floor, not the ceiling. In his book Newton also used his laws to show that the planets revolve around the suns in orbits that are oval, not round. Newton also discovered diffraction. This led him to enter the field of physics, where he prospered. When most people think of Isaac Newton, they think of him sitting under an apple tree watching an apple fall. Some people believe the apple fell onto his head. Newton understood that what makes things like apples fall to the ground is a specific kind of force — the force we call gravity. Newton thought that gravity was the force of attraction between two objects, such as an apple and the earth. He also thought that an object with more matter exerted the same force on smaller objects as they exerted on it. That meant that the large mass of the earth pulled objects toward it. That is why the apple fell down instead of up, and why people do not float in the air. Isaac Newton went on thinking about gravity. Before Newton, people thought that only objects near to the earth would fall down. But Newton thought that gravity should not just be limited to the earth and the objects on it. What if gravity went to the moon and beyond? Newton invented a formula for calculating the force of attraction between two bodies. He used it to calculate the force needed to keep the moon moving around the earth. Then he compared it with the force that made the apple fall downward. After allowing for the fact that the moon is much farther from the earth, and has a much greater mass, he discovered that the forces were the same. The moon is held in an orbit around the earth by the pull of earth's gravity. The formula invented by Newton is called the Law of gravitation.</p>

                <p>Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, at The Mount House, in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. Charles Robert Darwin was a British naturalist best known for developing the theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin, known as the "Father of Evolutionary Theory," made two significant contributions to the concept of evolution. First, Darwin gathered considerable evidence in support of the theory of descent with the change, a kinematic theory that deals with non-causal relationships between things—in other words, it deals with the evolution trend. Second, Darwin suggested the theory of natural selection as a mechanism for the observed pattern. This is a complex theory that deals with the evolution process and includes processes and causal relationships. In the 19th century Charles Darwin conducted extensive study related to nature for more than 2 decades. The observations related to animal distribution, plus the relationship between the living and the extinct animals was found by him. He also found that it's not just these but there is also a relationship between other species that used to exist millions of years back and present animals who share similarities to some extent. The theory of evolution suggested  by Charles Darwin is the most accepted theory and the best explanation of the existence of life on the earth. Charles Darwin Theory is considered as an important theory because of the following reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It stated that the first cellular forms of life existed on the earth about 2000 million years ago.</li>
                        <li>Later single celled, multicellular and invertebrates were formed.</li>
                        <li>Jawless fish also evolved and different organisms started living on land from water. Later, other animals such as viviparous mammals existed.</li>
                        <li>The primates that were similar to today's gorillas and chimpanzees existed about a million years ago. </li>
                        <li>Living organisms reproduce and grow naturally.</li>
                        <li>No two individuals are similar to each other and they differ in their physical features, behavior and other characteristics.</li>
                        <li>Some features are transferred from parents to their offspring.</li>
                        <li>The rate of reproduction differs in all living organisms. Some reproduce more and some less.</li>

                <p>Nikola Tesla was a well-known Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and mechanical engineer who was awarded about 300 patents for his inventions. He was born in Smiljan, Croatia on July 10, 1856. Tesla's mother, Duka, was an early inspiration to him as she invented small household appliances during his childhood. Tesla clearly inherited his mother's inventive spirit, as he went on to develop some of the most important inventions in history, such as alternating current (AC) electricity and the Tesla Coil. Growing up, Tesla studied in various places in Europe including Germany, Austria, and Prague. In the late 1870s, he had the opportunity to go to Budapest where he worked at the Telephone Exchange. While in Budapest he made improvements to some inventions and came up with his idea for the induction motor, which produced an alternating current system and used electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field, instead of electrical connections to the rotor. He later tried to gain attention for his proposed invention but didn't gain any recognition. At age 28, in 1884, he decided to move to the U.S. where there were more opportunities. While in the U.S. Tesla met Thomas Edison and worked alongside him for a couple of months. When Edison refused to pay Tesla for his work, Tesla decided to leave and pursue his own journey as an inventor. In 1887, Tesla received funding to start a company from American entrepreneur George Westinghouse. Tesla was able to finalize his induction motor to compete against Edison's direct current system. Tesla's motor was certainly an asset during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century as it was found to be more durable, cheaper, and more efficient than his competitors. Tesla licensed his invention to the Westinghouse Company in 1888. In 1893, Tesla achieved a milestone at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. This exposition was the turning point for public acceptance of alternating current as it dispelled the public's doubts about the safety and reliability of alternating current. . The exposition demonstrated that alternating current could run smoothly and it later became the main standard for power systems.</p>

                <p>Galileo was a natural philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who contributed significantly to the sciences of motion, astronomy, and material strength, as well as the establishment of the scientific method. He also made ground-breaking telescopic discoveries, including Jupiter's four biggest moons. Galileo Galilei was dubbed the "Father of Modern Science" by his contemporaries. He was an astronomer and scientist from Italy who started the scientific revolution. Some of his greatest accomplishments, which make him the father of modern science, are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Galileo discovered the hydrostatic balance: Using the Archimedes principle, Galileo devised a hydrostatic balance in which the counterweight was wrapped in metal wire. By counting the number of turns on the wire, the amount of water transported by the material in the water at the counterweight was computed. The proportions of metals such as gold and silver were calculated using this method.</li>
                        <li>The thermoscope paved the way for the contemporary thermometer: Galileo designed a thermoscope to detect temperature by observing the rise and fall of the liquid inside the thermoscope. It was made out of a water-filled vase attached to a narrow vertical pipe with an empty glass ball on top. The temperature change affected the rise and fall of the water in this thin vertical pipe.</li>
                        <li>The Galileo telescope was invented when Galileo learned about the first refracting telescope in the Netherlands. Galileo's telescope magnified objects 30 times and aided in the study of the sky. He became known as the "Father of Observational Astronomy" as a result of this create</li>

                    Galileo had a long-lasting influence on scientists, not least because of his courage to confront the church and defend his results. His modifications to the telescope resulted in astronomical advancements. When Sir Isaac Newton developed his own theories, he built on Galileo's findings.

                <p>Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher who made important developments in mathematics, astronomy, and the theory of music. The theorem now known as Pythagoras's theorem was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier but he may have been the first to prove it.Pythagoras of Samos was a Greek Philosopher and was considered to be the Son of a gem-engraver of an island of Samos. In the First Century, Pythagoras came up with a theorem that says, “the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.”  This theorem is known as Pythagoras theorem. After discovering this theorem Pythagoras sacrificed an ox to God. Later, when this story started making a name for itself, one of the Pythagorean opponents named Cicero mocked the story saying that Pythagoras made the sacrifice of blood illegal then how can he sacrifice an ox. Porphyry, one of his followers, tried to justify the story claiming that the ox was made up of dough.It is also believed that the theorem discovered by Pythagoras was actually used by Babylonians 1000 of years before Pythagoras. The only difference was they used this theorem for an isosceles right-angled triangle where two sides of the right-angled triangle (i.e, base and height) were the same. Indian mathematicians also used this theorem from Sulbasutras which was written long before Pythagoras discovered the theorem. Apart from Indian, Chinese and Egyptian also used this theorem for various construction purposes. </p>

                <p>Carl Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, taxonomist, and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. He is known as the "father of modern taxonomy". Linnaeus was born in Rashult, the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death.</p>

                <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 1920 to 16 April 1958)[1] was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during her life, for which she has been variously referred to as the "wronged heroine", the "dark lady of DNA", the "forgotten heroine", a "feminist icon" and the "Sylvia Plath of molecular biology". She graduated in 1941 with a degree in natural sciences from Newnham College, Cambridge, and then enrolled for a PhD in physical chemistry under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. She discovered the key properties of DNA, which eventually facilitated the correct description of the double helix structure of DNA. Franklin is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA while at King's College London, particularly Photo 51, taken by her student Raymond Gosling, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix for which Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962.</p>

                <p>Madame Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who front ran experimental research into radioactivity, progressing pioneering techniques for isolating radioactive elements and putting them to viable use. Madame Marie Curie was born in Warsaw, Poland on 7th November, 1867, as the daughter of a school teacher. She had done an extensive education in regional schools and got some scientific knowledge from her father. In 1891, she went to Paris to carry on with her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained a Bachelor degree in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in the following year they were married. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the tragic death of Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General Physics as the faculty in the field of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also designated the Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914. Her early researches along with her husband, were regularly performed under difficult conditions, laboratory arrangements were very poor and both had to tackle much teaching to earn a daily bread. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant research and analysis which led to the isolation of polonium, named after Marie's birth country, and radium. Madame Curie received a joint award for Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in radioactivity in 1903. In 1911, she received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of elements radium and polonium.Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive sublimates in sufficient quantities to enable its enactment and the careful study of its properties, therapeutic properties in particular.</p>

                <p>Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer. When she was a teenager (18), her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</p>
