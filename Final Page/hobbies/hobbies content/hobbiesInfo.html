                <h1>ORIGAMI</h1>
                <p>It is the Japanese art of folding paper to create both 2D and 3D figures and decorative shapes.
                  <br><br>
                  Origami is a well-suited activity to do with the whole classroom. In a multi-age classroom, irrespective of their age, children learn from each other and eventually,they understand the importance of cooperative learning.
                  It unites the children with similar thoughts and helps in community building.
                  <br><br>
                  Transforming a flat piece of paper into a three-dimensional figure is a unique exercise that develops math skills and special reasoning in children. Through hands-on activities, children learn the concept of symmetry and to manipulate basic geometric shapes such as squares, rectangles and triangles.</p>

                <h1>MARTIAL ARTS</h1>
                <p>A sport that is originated chiefly in Japan, Korea and China as forms of self-defence or attack.
                  <br><br>
                  Almost all types of Martial Arts have a belt or ranking system that children work through, meaning they are rewarded for their practice and mastery of skills. Focusing on a goal such as achieving a new rank or belt is a great way to learn about goal-setting and motivation.
                  Martial arts improves confidence and build self-esteem in children. Continuous and vigorous practice makes the body flexible and improves both mental and physical stamina.</p>
